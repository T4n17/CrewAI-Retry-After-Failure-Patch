# CrewAI Retry-After-Failure Patch

## Overview

This patch enhances the CrewAI framework by implementing a robust retry mechanism for task execution. When a task fails due to an exception, the patch allows the system to automatically retry the task execution a configurable number of times before giving up, improving the resilience and reliability of CrewAI workflows.

## Problem Statement

In the standard CrewAI implementation, when a task execution fails due to an exception (such as API rate limits, temporary network issues, or transient service disruptions), the entire workflow fails immediately. This creates several problems:

1. **Lack of Resilience**: Temporary failures cause complete workflow termination
2. **Wasted Resources**: All progress made before the failure is lost
3. **Poor User Experience**: Users must manually restart workflows after transient errors
4. **No Graceful Degradation**: The system has no built-in mechanism to recover from failures

## Solution

This patch modifies the `_execute_core` method of the `Task` class to implement a retry mechanism with the following features:

### Key Features

1. **Configurable Retry Count**: Set maximum number of retry attempts (default: 5)
2. **Configurable Delay Between Retries**: Set the waiting period between retry attempts (default: 5 seconds)
3. **Graceful Failure Handling**: After exhausting all retry attempts, the task completes with a failure status rather than raising an exception
4. **Event Emission**: Proper events are emitted for task failures and completions, maintaining compatibility with the CrewAI event system
5. **Transparent Integration**: The patch monkey-patches the original method, requiring no changes to existing code that uses CrewAI

### Technical Implementation

The patch:

1. Defines a new implementation of `_execute_core` that wraps the original execution logic
2. If retries are available (max_retries > 0):
   - Decrements the retry counter
   - Waits for the specified delay period
   - Recursively calls itself to retry the task execution
3. If retries are exhausted:
   - Emits a TaskCompletedEvent with a failure status instead of re-raising the exception
   - Allows the workflow to continue with subsequent tasks

## Usage

### Installation

1. Place the `main.py` file in your project
2. Import it at the beginning of your CrewAI workflow:

```python
import main  # This automatically applies the patch when imported
```

### Configuration

You can configure the retry behavior by defining max_retries and delay parameters in the _execute_core method:

```python
from crewai import Task

# Define max_retries and delay parameters in the _execute_core method
def _execute_core(
        self,
        agent: Optional[BaseAgent],
        context: Optional[str],
        tools: Optional[List[Any]],
        max_retries: Optional[int] = 5,
        delay: Optional[int] = 5,
    ) -> TaskOutput:
```

### Default Values

If not specified:
- `max_retries` defaults to 5 attempts
- `delay` defaults to 5 seconds between retries

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: Workflows can recover from transient failures automatically
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Progress is preserved through temporary disruptions
3. **Better User Experience**: Reduced manual intervention required for workflow completion
4. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operation even when individual tasks fail after retries
5. **Compatibility**: Works with existing CrewAI code without requiring modifications

## Limitations

1. The patch only handles exceptions during task execution, not logical errors in task output
2. Very long-running tasks that fail near completion will still need to restart from the beginning
3. The patch does not implement progressive backoff for retry delays (each delay is fixed)
